## [Unreleased]

## 0.5.1 â€“ 2018-03-26
### Fixed
- Support hlint 2.1, see <https://github.com/lunaryorn/vscode-hlint/issues/7>
  and <https://github.com/lunaryorn/vscode-hlint/pull/8>

## 0.5.0 â€“ 2017-08-24
### Changed
- Run hlint and apply-refact through [stack](http://haskellstack.org) to avoid
  global installation of hlint and apply-refact
- Relicense under Apache 2.0

## 0.4.1 â€“ 2017-06-26
### Added
- Use Haskell logo in Marketplace and set a gallery bannery color, see
  <https://github.com/lunaryorn/vscode-hlint/issues/5>

### Changed
- Relicense under MIT (formerly GPL-3).

## 0.4.0 â€“ 2017-06-02
### Added
- Lint documents on the fly when changed.

### Changed
- The extension now fails to activate if HLint is not present or if the HLint
  version does not meet the requirements of this extension (see below).
- Do not provide code actions (e.g. the light bulb) if `apply-refact` is not
  installed or doesn't have the expected version (see README).

## 0.3.2 â€“ 2017-05-28
### Changed
- Require HLint >=2.0.8 or HLint < 2 and >= 1.9.25 because the extension now
  feeds document contents to HLint on standard input which only works in the
  aforementioned versions.

### Fixed
- Only lint Haskell files.  I simply forgot this check ðŸ™ˆ.

## 0.3.1 â€“ 2017-05-22
### Added
- Add more metadata for the marketplace side.

## 0.3.0 â€“ 2017-05-22
### Changed
- Improve title of quick fixes.
- Apply quick fixes as workspace edit, for better undo and more reliable text
  replacement, see <https://github.com/lunaryorn/vscode-hlint/issues/2>.

## 0.2.0 - 2017-05-21
### Added
- Apply suggestions from HLint (requires [apply-refact][]).
